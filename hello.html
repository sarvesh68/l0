A p-n junction consists of two semiconductor regions with opposite doping type as shown in Figure 4.2.1. The region on the left is p-type with an acceptor density Na, while the region on the right is n-type with a donor density Nd. The dopants are assumed to be shallow, so that the electron (hole) density in the n-type (p-type) region is approximately equal to the donor (acceptor) density.
